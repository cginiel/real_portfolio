<!-- Hello to my friends reading the code! This project was my first time using bootstrap. It's been pretty fun, 
but it's also way different (i.e. more counterintuitive) than how I was taught to code.

	          <p>Compass targets an issue that I'm personally passionate about. Planning a camping trip can be a 
	          complicated process. While people may get better at planning these trips the more they take, camping 
	        	can be intimidating for the beginner. Plus, everyone can benefit from a more organized trip. Compass 
	        	streamlines the trip planning process by allowing users to plan and coordinate trips with friends.</p>

	          <p>In order to learn first-hand about major pain points in camping and trip planning, I interviewed 
	          people. These semi-structured interviews were great for gathering rich data, allowing me to probe

	          shortcomings of personas, in that they may become "objectified assumptions about end users" that "fit stereotyped but 
	          unvalidated user needs" (Costanza-Chock, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice" class="text-reset" target="
	          _blank">Design Justice &#x2197;</a>, 83). While I based my personas off of my research as much as possible and believe they 
	        	are useful to this project, they are still imperfect. I've included them here nonetheless because they 1) influenced 
	        	Compass's design and 2) demonstrate that every designer continues to grow the more they learn about their field.</p>
