<!-- Hello to my friends reading the code! This project was my first time using bootstrap. It's been pretty fun, 
but it's also way different (i.e. more counterintuitive) than how I was taught to code.

accessible as it could be, email me at cameronginiel@gmail.com -->

	          <p>Compass targets an issue that I'm personally passionate about. Planning a camping trip can be a complicated process. While people may get better at planning these trips the more they take, camping can be intimidating for the beginner. Plus, everyone can benefit from a more organized trip. Compass streamlines the trip planning process by allowing users to plan and coordinate trips with friends.</p>

	          <p>I had a feeling that I wasn't alone in my trip planning weak spots. I conducted some research to figure out if others were experiencing similar issues; I wanted to know when and why people were facing problems when camping and how well prepared they were before taking a trip.</p>

	          <h5>Research Questions</h5>
	          <ol>
	          	<li>When camping, how do people prepare for the outdoors?</li>
	          	<li>What is the role of a mobile device when camping?</li>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Interviews</h1>
	          <p>In order to learn first-hand about major pain points in camping and trip planning, I interviewed people. These semi-structured interviews were great for gathering rich data, allowing me to probe about each person's specific camping needs and decisions. There was a broad spectrum of camping experience among my participants, ranging from almost none to a lifetime of camping.</p>
	          <br>
	          <h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>People want a balance between planning and room for spontaneity.</li>
	          	<li>People need a way to coordinate bringing things among friends.</li>
	          	<li>Campers have varying levels of what they want out of their trip, especially depending on the nature of the trip.</li>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Competitive Analysis</h1>
	          <p>I next wanted to find out what other trip planning/camping platforms were out there to see how they compared to my vision of Compass. To get a sense of the variance among each platform, I listed the most important features of Compass and compared each platform based on those features. Unsurprisingly, campers have dozens of resources available to themâ€”however, to get the best of all platforms they'd have to be using several at a time.</p>
	          <br>
	          <h5>Key Takeaways</h5>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>Focus on the <span class="fw-bold">social aspect</span> of coordinating a camping trip.</li>
	          	<li>No one has a <span class="fw-bold">pack list</span> feature! (While this makes me wonder if there is a true need for a pack list, my need-finding interviews suggest that there is.)</li>
	          	<li>General complaints about poor information architecture and <span class="fw-bold">reliability of campground information.</span>
