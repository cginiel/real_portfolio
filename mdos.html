	          <p>The problem we addressed was broadly related to voting via absentee ballot in Michigan. Proposal 3 allows no-excuse absentee voting and same-day voter registration. Because of COVID-19, the Michigan Secretary of State sent out absentee ballot applications to all registered voters in Michigan, which increased the number of processing work carried by local clerks’ offices, who were already stretched thin because of social distancing guidelines. Specifically, we were interested in helping younger generations get access to the information they need in order to apply/receive/submit absentee ballots.</p>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Stakeholder Interviews</h1>
	          <p>The team was aware that there was a lot for us to learn about the voting process in Michigan, both from the bureaucratic side and the voter's side. To get a firmer grasp of the problem, we began interviewing city and township clerks about their local voting processes.</p>
	          <p class="muted-paragraph">Fun fact: Michigan is the only state in the U.S. whose voting is administered on a city and township level. Most other states in the U.S. administer voting on a county level. This means Michigan makes up about 25% of the entire country's voting entities with its 1,500+ cities and townships running elections.</p>
	          <br>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">What we wanted to know from city and township clerks:</span></p>
	          <ol>
	          	<li>What are clerks' pain points or frustrations surrounding the absentee voting process during the pandemic?</li>
	          	<li>How did they respond to those frustrations?</li>
	          	<li>What sort of interactions do they have with voters, including college students?</li>
	          </ol>
	          <p>After forming our research questions I created an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ikOEC1lvpPd1KIczf02vQMsuwXJ-xS4-/view" class="text-reset" target="

	          	<li>Leading up to the 2020 presidential election, much of the clerks' time was spent taking calls and responding to emails regarding questions about absentee voting.</li>
	          	<li>Clerks all had unique methods for informing the public about absentee voting in their city or township. These methods included creating informational videos, using social media channels to interact with voters (YouTube, facebook forums, etc.) and some even held in-person lectures.</li>

	          <p>While researching college students, we noticed that community college students had fewer resources available to them compared to students at a four year university. Furthermore, we saw that not only do community college students have a much lower voter turnout rate than their university counterparts, but they tend to be more passive about seeking voter information. We decided that it would be wise to design a solution for this population that we saw as underserved. We narrowed down our target audience as community college students between the ages of 18 and 25, which aligned with our client's goal of designing for harder-to-reach younger voters.</p>
	          <br>
						<p>At this point, I thought it would be wise to generate a wide array of ideas based on the information we gathered. I facilitated an open-ended design brainstorm session with two other group mates to rapidly come up with ideas.</p>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Refining Our Problem Statement and Participatory Design</h1>
	          <p>Once we narrowed our scope to community college students, we wanted to learn about their absentee voting experience and knowledge in more detail. We reached out to community partners involved in community college student recruitment and designed a survey to send to student bodies at various different community colleges in Southeast Michigan. To our surprise, we were unable to successfully send out our survey. Administrators of the community colleges we reached out to were uninterested in sending our survey to their students without an IRB approval.</p>
	          <br>
	          <p>Because our team only had a few weeks left before our project deadline, we decided to adjust our target audience to university students between ages 18 and 25 who are eligible to vote. We refined our problem statement once again and landed on:</p>
	          <p class="my-text-muted fst-italic ms-4 me-4">&#8220;How might we leverage information from existing trustworthy platforms to help college  
     				students answer questions around absentee voting and help them successfully submit the 
     				ballot?&#8221;</p>
     				<br>
	          <p>From the beginning of the project, our team's intention was to involve the community for which we were designing in the design process. In order to co-design with our target audience, we put together a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19BWPG-gHA_UOgOvGgZuEyv6Q2vVTVa1s/view" class="text-reset" target="
	          _blank">participatory design protocol &#x2197;</a> for virtual PD sessions. Our research questions for the virtual PD sessions were as follows:</p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>What are college students’ perceptions about voting absentee?</li>
	          	<li>What is their main confusion about the process?</li>
	          	<li>Where do they go when they have questions about absentee voting?</li>
	          	<li>What do they think about our design concepts?</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p>We decided that tapping into our network was the best way to ensure a relatively high response rate. We emailed the UMSI listserv to recruit participants. Another teammate and I conducted the participatory design sessions together.</p>

	          <p>Based on my need-finding interviews and other research, I created evidence-driven personas. The personas included here 
	          represent my two target users: campers and day hikers. Through the personas I was able to visualize with more clarity who 
	        	might be using Compass and what kind of unique needs or struggles they might have, providing me with more insight for feature 
	        	development.</p>

	          <p class="muted-paragraph">Designer's note: Scholar and design justice activist Dr. Sasha Costanza-Chock notes the crucial 
	          shortcomings of personas, in that they may become "objectified assumptions about end users" that "fit stereotyped but 
	          unvalidated user needs" (Costanza-Chock, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice" class="text-reset" target="
	          _blank">Design Justice &#x2197;</a>, 83). While I based my personas off of my research as much as possible and believe they 
	        	are useful to this project, they are still imperfect. I've included them here nonetheless because they 1) influenced 
	        	Compass's design and 2) demonstrate that every designer continues to grow the more they learn about their field.</p>

	          <p>Before jumping into digital interactions and designs, I wanted to create a flexible system of interactions that I could 
	          use for "hallway" tests. I put together a paper prototype of my interactions. The paper prototype was great for getting 
	        	peoples' quick impressions and making changes on the fly—I quickly learned which interactions were smooth and intuitive and 
	        	which interactions were clunky and disruptive.</p>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Features and Final Design</h1>
	          <p>Once my wireframes were in a good place and I had refined some interactions, I was ready to build features. Here are examples some of Compass's core features in its latest iteration.</p>
	        </div>
	      </div>
	      <!-- Feature 1 -->
	      <div class="row pt-5 align-items-center justify-content-evenly">
	      	<div class="col-10 col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-3 col-xl-3">

					</div>
					<div class="col-10 col-md-8 col-lg-5">
						<p class="mt-5"><span class="fw-bold">Add Item to Pack</span>
							<br><br>One of the core features of Compass, my design intention was to balance between simplicity and high functionality.</p>
					</div>
	      </div>
	      <!-- Feature 2 -->
	      <div class="row pt-5 align-items-center justify-content-evenly">
	      	<div class="col-10 col-md-8 col-lg-5">
						<p class="mt-5"><span class="fw-bold">Edit Trip Item Time</span>
							<br><br>There is a lot of granularity involved in planning a trip. I wanted to be sure I was paying close attention to the smaller, more detailed interactions in Compass. This feature allows people to change the time of a trip item. Further iterations of the prototype will allow people to swap trip items for replacements.</p>
					</div>
	      	<div class="col-10 col-sm-8 col-md-6 col-lg-3 col-xl-3 mt-5">

							  class="img-fluid">
					</div>
					<div class="col-10 col-md-8 col-lg-5">
						<p class="mt-5"><span class="fw-bold">Alternative Edit Trip Item Time</span>
							<br><br>My feeling was that there could be an alternative and more graceful way to edit a trip item's time without the option to replace the trip item with a different one. I designed another interaction for this. In the future, I would love to conduct user tests to compare the two edit trip time features and determine the usefulness of each.</p>
					</div>
	      </div>
	      <!-- Feature 4 -->
	      <div class="row pt-5 align-items-center justify-content-evenly">
	      	<div class="col-10 col-md-8 col-lg-5">
						<p class="mt-5"><span class="fw-bold">Discover Places</span>
							<br><br>The discover feature takes note of the user's interests in order to personalize recommendations for places to visit and camp. It can also be used to filter between terrain styles such as mountains, forests, and deserts.</p>

	          <ul>
	          	<li>I created Compass because I noticed a pain point in my own camping planning process that I thought could be smoother. I figured that most people would share the problems I was experiencing. This was not the case. Through my interviews and research I learned that everyone has very different styles, approaches, and needs when camping. Listening to their stories and distilling them into insights made Compass more accessible and more versatile.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Most, if not all, ideas already exist</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>My intention with Compass was not to re-invent the wheel but to make a specific tool that would benefit a particular group of people. By thinking of ways to bridge the gaps between, say, a trip planning app and a campground/trail encyclopedia, I was able to create a cohesive solution to a multi-faceted problem.</li>

	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Thoughtful graphic design is essential for cohesion</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>It was not until after I gained a solid understanding of graphic design that I 1) learned the importance of design elements such as color palettes, typography, and gestalt theory for buttressing interactions and 2) was able to revisit Compass to make it altogether cleaner and more whole.</li>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Future Work</h1>
	          <p>There are so many things that I believe users would benefit from that I have not yet been able to research, prototype, and test. A few of these features are:</p>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Booking and Reservations</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>An important part of planning a camping trip is ensuring you'll actually have a place to sleep at night. Connecting Compass to official booking services (such as what the DNR of most states offers) could streamline the camping planning experience even more. </li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Personal Trip Curation</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>A popular feature of many tools and mobile apps is an awareness of the user's tendencies and preferences (such as Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist). I believe that Compass would benefit from a user-centered algorithm that generates curated destinations, itineraries, and activity suggestions based on a user's past activity.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">User Reviews</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>User reviews are extremely helpful for offering guidance to people who want to know more about an area they've never visited before.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Gamification</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>Many apps that keep track of users' experiences, in addition to their primary function, offer "awards" or recognition based on a user meeting certain goals. Adding elements of gamification as a way to track experiential milestones can be a fun way to encourage more outdoor activity or adventurism.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Making Interactions Even More Seamless</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>Additionally, there are so many interactions that I'd like to offer alternatives for (such as designing an easier way to adjust the time of a trip event). I'm excited to work on refining those interactions in further iterations of Compass.</li>
