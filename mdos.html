	          <p>The problem we addressed was broadly related to voting via absentee ballot in Michigan. Proposal 3 allows no-excuse absentee voting and same-day voter registration. Because of COVID-19, the Michigan Secretary of State sent out absentee ballot applications to all registered voters in Michigan, which increased the number of processing work carried by local clerks’ offices, who were already stretched thin because of social distancing guidelines. Specifically, we were interested in helping younger generations get access to the information they need in order to apply/receive/submit absentee ballots.</p>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Stakeholder Interviews</h1>
	          <p>The team was aware that there was a lot for us to learn about the voting process in Michigan, both from the bureaucratic side and the voter's side. To get a firmer grasp of the problem, we began interviewing city and township clerks about their local voting processes.</p>
	          <p class="muted-paragraph">Fun fact: Michigan is the only state in the U.S. whose voting is administered on a city and township level. Most other states in the U.S. administer voting on a county level. This means Michigan makes up about 25% of the entire country's voting entities with its 1,500+ cities and townships running elections.</p>
	          <br>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">What we wanted to know from city and township clerks:</span></p>
	          <ol>
	          	<li>What are clerks' pain points or frustrations surrounding the absentee voting process during the pandemic?</li>
	          	<li>How did they respond to those frustrations?</li>
	          	<li>What sort of interactions do they have with voters, including college students?</li>
	          </ol>
	          <p>After forming our research questions I created an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ikOEC1lvpPd1KIczf02vQMsuwXJ-xS4-/view" class="text-reset" target="

	          	<li>Leading up to the 2020 presidential election, much of the clerks' time was spent taking calls and responding to emails regarding questions about absentee voting.</li>
	          	<li>Clerks all had unique methods for informing the public about absentee voting in their city or township. These methods included creating informational videos, using social media channels to interact with voters (YouTube, facebook forums, etc.) and some even held in-person lectures.</li>

	          <p>While researching college students, we noticed that community college students had fewer resources available to them compared to students at a four year university. Furthermore, we saw that not only do community college students have a much lower voter turnout rate than their university counterparts, but they tend to be more passive about seeking voter information. We decided that it would be wise to design a solution for this population that we saw as underserved. We narrowed down our target audience as community college students between the ages of 18 and 25, which aligned with our client's goal of designing for harder-to-reach younger voters.</p>
	          <br>
						<p>At this point, I thought it would be wise to generate a wide array of ideas based on the information we gathered. Using the rapid ideation method, I facilitated an open-ended design brainstorm session with two other group mates to quickly generate ideas.</p>

	          <p>Once we had a strong understanding of the kinds of designs we were thinking of prototyping, I conducted a comparative analysis to observe the strengths and weaknesses of other organizations' similar technologies.

Even worse, they may be left confused and frustrated about how to proceed.</li>
	          	<li>While all services do include the documents needed to vote absentee (such as absent voter (AV) ballot applications), <span class="fw-bold">much digging is required</span> to find them. Voters may benefit from an easier way to find these documents.

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Refining Our Problem Statement and Participatory Design</h1>
	          <p>Once we narrowed our scope to community college students, we wanted to learn about their absentee voting experience and knowledge in more detail. We reached out to community partners involved in community college student recruitment and designed a survey to send to student bodies at various different community colleges in Southeast Michigan. To our surprise, we were unable to successfully send out our survey. Administrators of the community colleges we reached out to were uninterested in sending our survey to their students without an IRB approval.</p>
	          <br>
	          <p>Because our team only had a few weeks left before our project deadline, we decided to adjust our target audience to university students between ages 18 and 25 who are eligible to vote. We refined our problem statement once again and landed on:</p>
	          <p class="my-text-muted fst-italic ms-4 me-4">&#8220;How might we leverage information from existing trustworthy platforms to help college  
     				students answer questions around absentee voting and help them successfully submit the 
     				ballot?&#8221;</p>
     				<br>
	          <p>From the beginning of the project, our team's intention was to involve the community for which we were designing in the design process. In order to co-design with our target audience, we put together a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19BWPG-gHA_UOgOvGgZuEyv6Q2vVTVa1s/view" class="text-reset" target="
	          _blank">participatory design protocol &#x2197;</a> for virtual PD sessions. Our research questions for the virtual PD sessions were as follows:</p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>What are college students’ perceptions about voting absentee?</li>
	          	<li>What is their main confusion about the process?</li>
	          	<li>Where do they go when they have questions about absentee voting?</li>
	          	<li>What do they think about our design concepts?</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p>Additionally, after more conversations and considerations about our original solutions, we altered some of our solutions and wanted to find out what our PD session participants thought of them. The solutions we presented to our participants were:</p>
	          <ol>
	          	<li>A voter hotline for answering student voters' questions</li>
	          	<li>A chat box built into the MDOS website</li>
	          	<li>A student voter guide available on MDOS's website and elsewhere (e.g. social media)</li>
	          	<li>An SMS service texting confirmation of updates throughout the absentee voting process</li>
	          </ol>
	          <p>We decided that tapping into our network was the best way to ensure a relatively high response rate. We emailed the UMSI listserv to recruit participants. Another teammate and I conducted the participatory design sessions together.</p>

	          <p>After each participatory design session, myself and another group member distilled our findings in excel using the Elito Method. We chose this method because it offered a way to quickly articulate and justify the value of our co-designs in a way that would meet our client's needs.</p>

	          <p>Below are our three key findings, all of which informed our recommendations to the Michigan Department of State:</p>
	          <p><span class="fw-bold">Finding 1:</span> While the majority of the students we interviewed believe the process of absentee voting is as trustworthy as in-person voting, two of the participants expressed some concerns they had about whether their ballots would arrive on time. In addition, there seems to be common questions around when and whether their votes will eventually be counted. Participants indicated that they would have liked a notification for when their ballots had been received and counted. Furthermore, all students we interviewed expressed the desire to receive confirmation messages from the state about almost every step of the absentee voting process.</p>
						<p><span class="fw-bold">Recommendation 1:</span> We recommended providing confirmation texts from the SOS to indicate when voters (including university students) have successfully registered, submitted their application, and cast their ballots. In addition, the confirmation would also include that the ballot has been counted for this election.</p>

	          <p><span class="fw-bold">Finding 2:</span> Students are not familiar with the absentee voting process—especially during registration, submitting absentee ballot applications and casting the ballots themselves. Many students had questions regarding how long they should spend completing each step, and what to expect after they finish each step.</p>
						<p><span class="fw-bold">Recommendation 2:</span> Based on the pain points we discovered throughout our research, we recommended adding our video and our "one-pager" student voter guide to the Secretary of State website in addition to other social media channels. The video and the one-pager list each step of the absentee voting process, with short explanations (timeline, where, how) that will help students successfully cast their absentee ballot.</p>

    			<div class="col-12 col-sm-10 col-lg-6">
	          <p><span class="fw-bold">Finding 3:</span> Students prefer text-based communication. Most students stated that they will only call their local clerks if their questions are complex. Based on our participatory design sessions, students preferred using the chat box in the SOS website to directly ask questions, as opposed to texting a phone number, since the chat box allows them to stay on one platform while searching for voting information.</p>
						<p><span class="fw-bold">Recommendation 3:</span> We recommended implementing a chat box function alongside a telephone hotline option to call the state officials for help. The chatbot would aim to answer a large majority of the most common voter questions, and could list scenarios in which students could call the hotline number when they have more complex or specific questions.</p>

	          <p>Our client was pleased with our recommendations, specifically regarding the multiple solutions we offered. They especially appreciated the video and the one-pager, as those showed a sensitivity to their immediate needs—the video and one-pager could be distributed on their website and social media right away at virtually no cost. They showed interest in the SMS service but expressed that due to the timing of the pandemic combined with a particularly tense presidential election cycle, they would not be able to dedicate time to work on that feature anytime soon. Should they choose to explore that option in the future, we provided them with an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13iyU9a86HmUWnIyljN7TgKOFvoD2zaiF/view" class="text-reset" target="

	          <ul>
	          	<li>This project was unique in that our team and our assignment was formed a couple of months after COVID-19 halted life as we knew it in the United States. While I was ready to be creative and optimistic about my fully remote collaborative work, I knew that a virtual internship would come with its challenges. Throughout this project I learned that honesty with your collaborators, as well as being flexible and compassionate are essential for team wellness.</li>

	          <ul>
	          	<li>Understanding that working with government organizations often means designing within extreme budget and human resource limitations.</li>
	          	<li>This meant that I needed to think of a diverse array of designs to recommend to the client, ranging from zero budget solutions (an informational video) to solutions that require more time and resources (implementing a chat box function on the Secretary of State's website). Pitching multiple solutions opened up the possibility for our client to take advantage of the &#8220;lowest hanging fruit&#8221; options first, and begin planning for the longer term solutions down the line.</li>
