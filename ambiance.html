	          <p>Our motivation for this project stemmed from the question: "How has working from home impacted people's moods?"</p>
	          <p>We know that due to COVID-19 people have reported feeling isolated, lonely, and depressed at home (<a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/covid-19-blues-vs--depression--mood-disorder-how-to-tell-the-difference.h00-159385101.html" class="text-reset" target="
	          _blank">MD Anderson Cancer Center & Adams, M., 2020 &#x2197;</a>). Everything from work to school to social activities was solely within the home, making this a significant change that everyone had to adjust to. We wanted to use technology to help people, specifically those between 24-40 years old working on computers at home, better manage their mood within the household.

Ambiance is a smart mood ring that combines pervasive sensing technologies, to know where a person is in their home, with biometric tracking to make wellness recommendations based on its perception of wearers' moods. Using an accompanying app, the wearer can track their habits and plan short-term and long-term mood management along with the help of the ring.</p>

	          <p class="muted-paragraph">Designer's note: Scholar and design justice activist Dr. Sasha Costanza-Chock notes the crucial 
	          shortcomings of personas, in that they may become "objectified assumptions about end users" that "fit stereotyped but 
	          unvalidated user needs" (Costanza-Chock, <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice" class="text-reset" target="
	          _blank">Design Justice &#x2197;</a>, 83). While I based my personas off of my research as much as possible and believe they 
	        	are useful to this project, they are still imperfect. I've included them here nonetheless because they 1) influenced 
	        	Compass's design and 2) demonstrate that every designer continues to grow the more they learn about their field.</p>

							<br><br>There is a lot of granularity involved in planning a trip. I wanted to be sure I was paying close attention to the smaller, more detailed interactions in Compass.

						<p class="mt-5"><span class="fw-bold">Alternative Edit Trip Item Time</span>
							<br><br>My feeling was that there could be an alternative and more graceful way to edit a trip item's time without the option to replace the trip item with a different one. I designed another interaction for this. In the future, I would love to conduct user tests to compare the two edit trip time features and determine the usefulness of each.</p>

	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Avoiding my inherent bias</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>I created Compass because I noticed a pain point in my own camping planning process that I thought could be smoother. I figured that most people would share the problems I was experiencing. This was not the case. Through my interviews and research I learned that everyone has very different styles, approaches, and needs when camping. Listening to their stories and distilling them into insights made Compass more accessible and more versatile.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Most, if not all, ideas already exist</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>My intention with Compass was not to re-invent the wheel but to make a specific tool that would benefit a particular group of people. By thinking of ways to bridge the gaps between, say, a trip planning app and a campground/trail encyclopedia, I was able to create a cohesive solution to a multi-faceted problem.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Thoughtful graphic design is essential for cohesion</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>It was not until after I gained a solid understanding of graphic design that I 1) learned the importance of design elements such as color palettes, typography, and gestalt theory for buttressing interactions and 2) was able to revisit Compass to make it altogether cleaner and more whole.</li>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Future Work</h1>
	          <p>There are so many things that I believe users would benefit from that I have not yet been able to research, prototype, and test. A few of these features are:</p>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Booking and Reservations</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>An important part of planning a camping trip is ensuring you'll actually have a place to sleep at night. Connecting Compass to official booking services (such as what the DNR of most states offers) could streamline the camping planning experience even more. </li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Personal Trip Curation</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>A popular feature of many tools and mobile apps is an awareness of the user's tendencies and preferences (such as Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist). I believe that Compass would benefit from a user-centered algorithm that generates curated destinations, itineraries, and activity suggestions based on a user's past activity.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">User Reviews</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>User reviews are extremely helpful for offering guidance to people who want to know more about an area they've never visited before.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Gamification</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>Many apps that keep track of users' experiences, in addition to their primary function, offer "awards" or recognition based on a user meeting certain goals. Adding elements of gamification as a way to track experiential milestones can be a fun way to encourage more outdoor activity or adventurism.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Making Interactions Even More Seamless</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>Additionally, there are so many interactions that I'd like to offer alternatives for (such as designing an easier way to adjust the time of a trip event). I'm excited to work on refining those interactions in further iterations of Compass.</li>
