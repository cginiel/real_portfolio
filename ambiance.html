	          <p>Our motivation for this project stemmed from the question: "How has working from home impacted people's moods?"</p>
	          <p>We know that due to COVID-19 people have reported feeling isolated, lonely, and depressed at home (<a href="https://www.mdanderson.org/cancerwise/covid-19-blues-vs--depression--mood-disorder-how-to-tell-the-difference.h00-159385101.html" class="text-reset" target="
	          _blank">MD Anderson Cancer Center & Adams, M., 2020 &#x2197;</a>). Everything from work to school to social activities was solely within the home, making this a significant change that everyone had to adjust to. We wanted to use technology to help people, specifically those between 24-40 years old working on computers at home, better manage their mood within the household.

Ambiance is a smart mood ring that combines pervasive sensing technologies, to know where a person is in their home, with biometric tracking to make wellness recommendations based on its perception of wearers' moods. Using an accompanying app, the wearer can track their habits and plan short-term and long-term mood management along with the help of the ring.</p>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Diary Studies and Interviews</h1>
	          <p>The goal of the diary studies and interviews was to understand how furniture and other spaces within the home may impact individuals who are either a remote worker or student. We conducted a 5-day-long diary study and post-study interview with 8 individuals who were in their 20s and working from home.</p>
	          <br>
	          <h5>Our diary studies and interviews led us to these three key takeaways:</h5>
	          <ol>
	          	<li>Participants <span class="fw-bold">created different zones</span> in their home which affected their energy and productivity differently. Participants mentioned that lighting, plants, and the color of the room have an impact on their overall mood, as well as their energy and productivity. Additionally, participants would <span class="fw-bold">move to different zones </span>based on the pace of their work or school day&#8212;often going to a relaxing room for a break or moving between different working zones for a change of environment.</li>
	          	<li>Half of the participants <span class="fw-bold">did not own wearables</span> that would help track their activities. Those who did own a wearable mentioned that the notifications came at inconvenient times&#8212;most participants had their notifications turned off.</li>
	          	<li>There were <span class="fw-bold">various factors</span> that affected peoples' moods, such as variety in the type of tasks or interactions they had in a given day, the room's setup, the type of furniture they sat on, and noise levels in their home.</span>
	          	</li>
	          </ol>
	          <br>
	          <p>
	          	The findings from our formative studies helped us diverge from our original scope, which focused on posture, to our refined scope of managing mood within the home. After the formative studies we brainstormed and ideated concepts that would fit the needs of our users.

	          <h1 class="mb-4">User Enactments</h1>
	          <p>For the user enactments, we decided to focus on the concept of a smart mood ring. The goal of the user enactments was to help us understand what features are needed and what aspects of our technology should be in our final design. We ran through 5 scenarios with 5 participants. We created rings out of tin foil, verbally indicated the feedback from the ring and stimulated the users interactions with the app by sending text messages with specific verbiage.</p>
	          <br>
	          <h5>Our user enactments led us to these two takeaways:</h5>
	          <ol>
	          	<li>The activities the ring suggested <span class="fw-bold">needed to fit the user’s preferences</span> and home context. Users mentioned that there were activity suggestions that they would not consider (such as taking a walk when it's raining). This showed us that the app needs to have awareness of the user's preferences in order to optimize mood management.</li>
	          	<li>Not all users enjoyed in-the-moment mood identification. However, they would like to know their long term mood trends. Users felt that in certain situations (e.g. times of stress), confronting their current mood would exacerbate that mood. The ring should have a <span class="fw-bold">good sense of when to show feedback</span> and it should be able to show long-term trends and management tips instead of alert users during every mood swing.</li>
	          </ol>
	          <br>
	          <p>
	          	Based on the user enactment findings, we continued to iterate on our mood ring concept to best fit the needs of the user. Additionally, we used these findings to hone in on our original problem statement and solve for our problem with greater clarity.

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Prototype and Key Features</h1>
	          <p>Our research and key findings led us to our final product, Ambiance. This product has two key components: the smart mood ring and the accompanying mobile app. In order to demonstrate Ambiance, we created the physical ring using a breadboard, a Particle Photon, and an Adafruit NeoPixel Ring. We programmed our ring using C++ and employed the Wizard of Oz technique to demonstrate its usability. For the mobile app, we created a clickable digital prototype using Figma.</p>
	          <br>
	          <h5>The four key features of the product are as follows:</h5>
	          <ol>
	          	<li>Mood Identification: The ring uses multiple sensors to identify the user’s mood and the user is notified of a change in mood through either an illuminated color LED or a vibration feedback mechanism.</li>
	          	<li>Mood Tracking: The ring tracks the user’s mood throughout the day to identify trends over time. This data can be viewed in the app for short-term and long-term mood management.</li>
	          	<li>Location Awareness: The ring can associate specific moods with specific locations in the home to help with recommended activities and overall mood management.</li>
	          	<li>Personalized Recommendations: The app sends real-time or delayed activity recommendations to enhance/improve mood based on the user’s preferences. The app also makes recommendations based on factors such as the user's location within the home, overall mood trends, and other environmental factors such as local weather (for activities like recommending a walk).</li>

	          <p>Once I felt like I had a good understanding of what users of Compass desired, I mapped out user flows and user journeys. 
	          The user flows gave me a high level understanding of where each interaction would happen and what kinds of decisions the 
	        	users would need to make. The user journeys quickly showed me where interaction breakdowns might happen in a more specific 
	        	context. This helped me strategize my design decisions before jumping into more detailed designs.</p>

						<p class="mt-5"><span class="fw-bold">Edit Trip Item Time</span>
							<br><br>There is a lot of granularity involved in planning a trip. I wanted to be sure I was paying close attention to the smaller, more detailed interactions in Compass. This feature allows people to change the time of a trip item. Further iterations of the prototype will allow people to swap trip items for replacements.</p>

							<br><br>My feeling was that there could be an alternative and more graceful way to edit a trip item's time without the option to replace the trip item with a different one. I designed another interaction for this. In the future, I would love to conduct user tests to compare the two edit trip time features and determine the usefulness of each.</p>

	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Avoiding my inherent bias</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>I created Compass because I noticed a pain point in my own camping planning process that I thought could be smoother. I figured that most people would share the problems I was experiencing. This was not the case. Through my interviews and research I learned that everyone has very different styles, approaches, and needs when camping. Listening to their stories and distilling them into insights made Compass more accessible and more versatile.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Most, if not all, ideas already exist</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>My intention with Compass was not to re-invent the wheel but to make a specific tool that would benefit a particular group of people. By thinking of ways to bridge the gaps between, say, a trip planning app and a campground/trail encyclopedia, I was able to create a cohesive solution to a multi-faceted problem.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Thoughtful graphic design is essential for cohesion</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>It was not until after I gained a solid understanding of graphic design that I 1) learned the importance of design elements such as color palettes, typography, and gestalt theory for buttressing interactions and 2) was able to revisit Compass to make it altogether cleaner and more whole.</li>

	          <h1 class="mb-4">Future Work</h1>
	          <p>There are so many things that I believe users would benefit from that I have not yet been able to research, prototype, and test. A few of these features are:</p>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Booking and Reservations</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>An important part of planning a camping trip is ensuring you'll actually have a place to sleep at night. Connecting Compass to official booking services (such as what the DNR of most states offers) could streamline the camping planning experience even more. </li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Personal Trip Curation</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>A popular feature of many tools and mobile apps is an awareness of the user's tendencies and preferences (such as Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist). I believe that Compass would benefit from a user-centered algorithm that generates curated destinations, itineraries, and activity suggestions based on a user's past activity.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">User Reviews</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>User reviews are extremely helpful for offering guidance to people who want to know more about an area they've never visited before.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Gamification</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>Many apps that keep track of users' experiences, in addition to their primary function, offer "awards" or recognition based on a user meeting certain goals. Adding elements of gamification as a way to track experiential milestones can be a fun way to encourage more outdoor activity or adventurism.</li>
	          </ul>
	          <p class="m-1"><span class="fw-bold">Making Interactions Even More Seamless</span></p>
	          <ul>
	          	<li>Additionally, there are so many interactions that I'd like to offer alternatives for (such as designing an easier way to adjust the time of a trip event). I'm excited to work on refining those interactions in further iterations of Compass.</li>
